This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Setup
## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or npm)

## Getting the code up and running
Clone [this repository](http://github.com/karljohann) and run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies.
```
git clone git@git.github.com:karljohann/flug.git
cd mmng
yarn
```
If all goes well, run `yarn start`. If not, be frustrated for 72 minutes and then rage posting on [some internet site] only to realise that you wrote `yarn strat`.
