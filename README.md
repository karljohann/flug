# Setup
## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or npm)

## Getting the code up and running
Clone [this repository](https://github.com/karljohann/flug) and run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies.
```
git clone git@github.com:karljohann/flug.git
cd flug
yarn
```
If all goes well, run `yarn start`. If not, be frustrated for 72 minutes and then rage posting on [some internet site] only to realise that you wrote `yarn strat`.
